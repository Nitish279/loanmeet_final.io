                                LoanMeet is a marketplace, and it does not disburse loans from its own books. It is any other marketplace platform where two parties enter into a transaction. That's why it does not come under preview of RBI. Having said that, RBI will soon come up with
                                guidelines on P2P lending, and alternative lending platforms.

                                                    less than Rs. 20 K per month, and we have given loans to individuals whose CIBIL was below 600. We can cover entire spectrum of lending institutions like banks, NBFCs, individuals. Trust us, we will get
                                                    you a loan at a lower interest rate.

At LoanMeet, we have excellent track record,i.e all loans are performing well. Unlike other platforms, not a single loan originated from LoanMeet has gone bad; all loan payments
                                                    were made on-time. Let us know if you want to talk to a fellow lender, we can arrange a call between you and an experienced lender.

                                                    We understand your concern. Before we give the loan amount, we try our best to ensure that this does not happen. However, despite our best efforts, it can happen. We will reach out to an outside collection agency, and ask it to collect the remaining principal,
                                                    interest, and penalty from the borrower. We will also help the lender file a legal case against the borrower. Please understand that we, LoanMeet, have not guaranteed the principal or interest amount. Before
                                                    giving a loan to an individual, we take post-dated cheques from the borrower. We follow a similar procedure that most financial institutions do to recover the loan amount. We have a six-step process to recover
                                                    the loan amount. We have partnered with leading recovery agencies to get you your money.

                                                    Let's hope this does not happen. Even if this occurs, then the legal loan agreement between borrower and lenders still holds true. You will not lose money, as the borrower is still obliged to make EMI payments.
